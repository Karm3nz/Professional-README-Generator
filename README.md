# Professional README Generator

## Description ‚úèÔ∏è

A good README is an extremely important part of your project's repository. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. 
The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. 

However, READMEs generally follow similar, if not the same format for most projects. It is unikely to find READMEs not following the format of having a Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions! 

Writing the layout of a README can get pretty repetitive, and that's where the Professional README Generator comes into play. It already has all of the structure of what a README requires! What is left for the user's part is to input the data of what makes their projects into the command-line!

This project features the inquirer npm to prompt necessary questions to fill in the pre-built layout of the README.


## Table of Contents üìú

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation üíæ

* Make sure to have a text editor of your choice installed (the example below shows "Visual Studio Code").
* Install node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* From the repository download zip file of the repository (found when you click on the green "Code" button)
* Inside your computer's command-line interface, navigate into the file "develop".
* Type in "npm install" to install the dependencies required to run the application.
* From here in the command-line, type in "node index.js" to run the application and prompt the questions required to generate a README.md file.

## Usage üîß

The usage of the Professional README Generator is to make the process of creating READMEs to be easier and faster by having a pre-built README format in place for the user to enter data into. 

After installation, the user can follow along with the prompted questions in the command-line until they're given the confirmation that the README.md file is successfully written to. From here, the user can navigate to the "dist" folder to view the generated README.
